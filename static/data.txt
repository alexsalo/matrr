The NIH Data Sharing Policy states "Data should be made as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of participants, and protecting confidential and proprietary data."

Data Sharing in the MATRR is as broad or restrictive as the contributing investigators allow. Access restrictions can be changed at any time. The only people with access to data are those identified by the MATRR sterring committee and the administrators of the website.
