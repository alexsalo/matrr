	<p> Visitors using Internet Explorer will have issues creating an account and logging in; these are known issues.  Due to its inconsistent compatibilities with web standards,
		Microsoft's Internet Explorer is specifically not supported by MATRR.</p>

	<p> MATRR developers use Google Chrome (<a href='http://www.google.com/chrome/'>website</a>) and Mozilla Firefox (<a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/'>website</a>)
		when developing and testing this site. Both browsers are free and fully support all aspects of this research site at the time of this writing. </p>

	<p> Google also provides a Chrome plugin for Internet Explorer <a href='http://www.google.com/chromeframe'>(available here)</a>which will run the Chrome browser within Internet Explorer. This may help IE users navigate and use the MATRR website.
	Currently Chrome frame is running correctly on our <a href="http://gleek.ecs.baylor.edu">university-based domain</a>. After installing Chrome frame, please restart your browser and
	switch to the <a href="http://gleek.ecs.baylor.edu">university-based domain</a>. We are working on Chrome-frame activation on www.matrr.com as well.</p>

	<p> Chrome and Firefox both have extensions which allow an instance of Internet Explorer to be run within one of their tabs. While still not supported, these may assist users seeking to
		permanently transition from Internet Explorer.</p>
