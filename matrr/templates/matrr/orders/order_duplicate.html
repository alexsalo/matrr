		To expedite the request process for return users MATRR allows you to create a duplicate request from a previously submitted request. This copied request will use a special
		status "Duplicated" and will not interfere with your cart. Duplicated requests have specific restrictions, discussed below.
	</div>
	<br>
	With Duplicated requests:
	<ul>
		<li>you can select a new cohort from which to request the same tissues</li>
		<li>you can change details of the request</li>
		<li>you can make changes to the requested tissues (monkeys, amount, units, notes etc.)</li>
		<li>you can delete requested tissues</li>
		<li>you <strong>cannot</strong> add new tissues. To request new tissues you must submit a new request.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="messages">
		Once you have finished making changes, you have to <strong>resubmit the request.</strong> A duplicated request is just your draft. The
		MATRR team cannot see or process the request until it has been submitted.
