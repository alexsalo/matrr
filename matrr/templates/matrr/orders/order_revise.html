	<div>
		<strong>A rejected request cannot be modified.</strong> However, we can create a copy of a rejected/partially rejected request for you to edit and resubmit.
		This copied request will use a special status "Revised" and will not interfere with your cart.  Revised requests have specific restrictions, discussed below.
	</div>
	<br>
	With Revised requests:
	<ul>
		<li>you can change details of the request</li>
		<li>you can make changes to the requested tissues (monkeys, amount, units, notes etc.)</li>
		<li>you can delete requested tissues</li>
		<li>you <strong>cannot</strong> add new tissues. To request new tissues you must submit a new request.</li>
		<li>you <strong>cannot</strong> change the cohort.</li>
		<li>you <strong>cannot</strong> select monkey tissues that were accepted in partially rejected orders.</li>
	</ul>



	<div class="messages">
		Once you have finished making changes, you have to <strong>resubmit the request.</strong> A revised request is just your draft. The
		MATRR team cannot see or process the request until it has been submitted.
