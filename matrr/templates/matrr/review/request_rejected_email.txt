After review, your request for MATRR tissue was not approved.  The most common reasons for a rejection are the lack of a submitted study plan, asking for more tissue than is available, or asking for a custom preparation that can not be performed on already frozen tissue.

If you have questions about why your request has been denied please contact MATRR staff.  Our contact information is provided <a href="https://gleek.ecs.baylor.edu/contact/">here</a>.
