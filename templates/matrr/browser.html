<div id='large-headline'>MATRR Browser Support Requirements and Information</div>
<p>
	Due to its inconsistent compatibilities with web standards, Microsoft's Internet Explorer is specifically not support by MATRR.
</p>

<p>
	MATRR developers use Google Chrome (<a href='http://www.google.com/chrome/'>website</a>) and Mozilla Firefox (<a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/'>website</a>) when developing and testing this site.  Both browsers are free, each fully supporting all aspects of this research site at the time of this writing.
</p>
<div id=headline>Browser Addons</div>
<p>
	Chrome provides a plugin for Internet Explorer which will run the Chrome browser within Internet Explorer.  This may help IE users navigate and use the MATRR website.
</p>

<p>
	<a href='http://www.google.com/chromeframe'>Chrome Frame is available here.</a>
</p>
	
<p>
	Chrome and Firefox both have extensions which allow an instance of Internet Explorer to be run within one of their tabs.  While still not supported, these may assist users seeking to transition from Internet Explorer more permanently.
