		To expedite the request process for return users MATRR allows you to create a duplicate request from a previously accepted request. This duplicate request
		<strong>cannot</strong> be modified, but it can be created to request tissues from another cohort, pending tissue availability.
		<strong>A rejected request cannot be duplicated.</strong> However, we can create a copy of an accepted/partially accepted request for you to resubmit.
		This copied order will use a special status "Duplicated" and will not interfere with your cart. Duplicated orders have specific restrictions, discussed below.
	</div>
	<br>
	With Duplicated orders:
	<ul>
		<li>you can select a new cohort from which to request tissues</li>
		<li>you can change details of the request</li>
		<li>you can make changes to the requested tissues (monkeys, amount, units, notes etc.)</li>
		<li>you can delete requested tissues</li>
		<li>you <strong>cannot</strong> add new tissues. To request new tissues you must submit a new request.</li>
		<li>you <strong>cannot</strong> select a cohort unless it all tissue originally requested are available in the new cohort</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="messages">
		Once you have finished making changes, you have to <strong>resubmit the order.</strong> A duplicated order is just your draft. The
		MATRR team cannot see or process the order until it has been submitted.
